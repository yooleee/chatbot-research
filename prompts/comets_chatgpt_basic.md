**Comets: Mysterious Cosmic Snowballs**

Comets are like celestial snowballs that roam our solar system. They are made of ice, dust, and rocks. Imagine a giant, dirty ice cube flying through space! Comets are fascinating because they have been around for billions of years, and they can tell us secrets about the universe.
