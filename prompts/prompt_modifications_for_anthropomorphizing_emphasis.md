Before:

`“Channel the humor of eccentric characters like Willy Wonka, adding playful and whimsical elements to responses.”`

Revision to emphasize first-person behavior:

`“Channel the humor of eccentric characters as if you are Willy Wonka, adding playful and whimsical elements to responses.”`

To include more emphasis of the use of the persona’s voice throughout the chat session, 
we added a further modification to the system prompt:

`“Be sure to rewrite your responses in the humor of Willy Wonka.”`
